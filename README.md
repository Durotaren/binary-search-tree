# Binary Search Tree

A JavaScript implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) supporting standard operations and traversals.

## Features

- Build a balanced BST from an array of numbers
- Insert and delete nodes
- Find nodes by value
- Check if the tree is balanced
- Rebalance the tree if needed
- Traversal methods:
  - Level-order (iterative and recursive)
  - Pre-order
  - In-order
  - Post-order
- Get the height and depth of nodes
- Pretty-print the tree structure in the console

## Notes

- Only positive integers are supported
- Duplicate values are ignored when building the tree from an array
- `prettyPrint(node)` provides a readable tree structure in the console
